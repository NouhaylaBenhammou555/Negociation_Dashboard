## 💰 THE REQUEST (2-3 minutes)

**[Navigate to Tab 3: Negotiation Summary]**

> "Based on this analysis, I'd like to discuss two things:
>
> **1. Title Progression: Junior Associate → Associate**  
> My responsibilities and contributions have already evolved beyond Junior Associate level. I'm designing systems from scratch, leading technical implementation on client projects, and owning end-to-end delivery.

**[Show Suggested Salary Targets card]**

> **2. Salary Adjustment to Market Rate**  
> I'm proposing a salary range of **$95,000 to $105,000**, which represents:
> - **Conservative (P25):** $95,000 — aligns with the 25th percentile for Montreal AI engineers
> - **Target (P50):** $100,000 — the market median for my experience and skill set
> - **Aspirational (P75):** $105,000 — reflects my GenAI specialization and high performance

**[Reference Career Aspirations card]**

> This isn't just about the immediate adjustment. I'm committed to Synechron long-term:
> - **2027:** I'm planning to pursue an MBA to complement my technical skills with business acumen
> - **2028:** I'm interested in international mobility opportunities within the Synechron network
> - **Long-term:** I want to lead AI/ML teams and drive strategic initiatives at the intersection of technology and business

> I see this salary adjustment as aligning my compensation with the value I'm already delivering, while positioning me to take on even greater responsibilities."

## 🔄 HANDLING OBJECTIONS (Prepare for 2-3 minutes)

**Objection 1: "We have salary bands for Junior Associates"**

> "I appreciate that, and that's exactly why I'm proposing the title change to Associate. My current responsibilities—system architecture, client-facing work, and technical leadership—align with Associate-level expectations. The salary adjustment reflects both the title progression and market alignment."

**Objection 2: "This is a significant increase"**

> "It's a 34% adjustment from $71K to $95K, which I understand is substantial. However, it's important to note that I'm currently 25% below market average. What I'm proposing is **market correction, not a premium**. The data shows that retaining AI engineering talent at below-market rates carries significant replacement costs—recruiting, onboarding, and productivity ramp-up for a new hire would likely exceed this adjustment."

**Objection 3: "We need to see more tenure before this level of increase"**

> "I have 2-3 years with Synechron, which is the exact experience level used in my market benchmarking. The 89 salary records I analyzed are for professionals with my tenure. Additionally, my technical skill acquisition rate is 85% above baseline—I'm not asking for potential, I'm asking for recognition of delivered value."

**Objection 4: "Can we do this in stages?"**

> "I'm open to discussing the implementation timeline. If a phased approach works better for budgeting cycles, I'd be comfortable with:
> - **Immediate:** Title change to Associate + adjustment to $95K (market P25)
> - **6-month review:** Performance-based increase to $100K-$105K range based on continued delivery
> 
> What's most important to me is the acknowledgment that my current compensation doesn't reflect market reality or my contributions."

**Objection 5: "What if we can't meet this range?"**

> "I'm genuinely committed to Synechron and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. If the full adjustment isn't feasible immediately, I'd like to explore:
> - Accelerated review timeline (3-6 months vs. annual)
> - Performance bonus structure tied to project delivery
> - Professional development budget for MBA preparation
> - Equity or stock options if available
> 
> My goal isn't to create hardship—it's to ensure my compensation reflects the AI engineering market and the value I'm contributing."
