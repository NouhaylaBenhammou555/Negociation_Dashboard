## 🎬 THE SCRIPT

### OPENING (2 minutes)

**[Enter meeting, make eye contact, smile]**

"Good morning/afternoon [Manager's Name]. Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. I really appreciate it.

I've been with Synechron for almost three years now, and I wanted to have a conversation about my career progression and compensation. I know this is an important discussion, so I've prepared a data-driven presentation that I'd like to walk you through. It should take about 15 to 20 minutes, and I'm happy to answer any questions along the way.

Is this still a good time for you?

**[Wait for confirmation]**

Great. Let me share my screen with you.

**[Share screen - Tab 1: Benchmark AI Market]**

So, what I've done is analyze the current market for AI engineers with my experience level. I wanted to make sure this conversation is grounded in real data, not just intuition."

---

### MARKET CONTEXT (4 minutes)

"Let me start by showing you what the market looks like right now for AI engineering roles in Canada, with a specific focus on Montreal.

**[Point to KPI strip]**

I analyzed 89 real salary records from Glassdoor and Levels.fyi. These aren't inflated numbers or wishful thinking—these are actual reported salaries from AI engineers across 15 Canadian cities. The median salary across all these roles is $111,000, and the 75th percentile is $148,000.

**[Navigate to Montreal AI Engineer 2-3 Years chart]**

Now, here's what's particularly relevant to my situation. When I filter this data specifically for Montreal AI engineers with 2 to 3 years of experience—which is exactly where I am—the numbers are very clear:

- The minimum salary is $57,000
- The average is $95,000
- The maximum is $125,000

I'm currently making $71,000 per year, which puts me about $24,000 below the market average. That's a 25% gap.

**[Pause for 2-3 seconds]**

**[Show Min/Avg/Max Distribution chart]**

When we zoom out and look at the broader Canadian market, you can see the range of salaries by city. Toronto is leading at an average of $148,000, Vancouver at $126,000, and even smaller markets are consistently above $100,000 for AI engineering roles with my experience level.

**[Navigate to AI Engineer Demand Growth chart]**

Now, why does this matter? Because the market is moving incredibly fast. This chart shows AI engineer demand from 2020 to 2030. We're looking at 540% growth over this decade. You can see here that when ChatGPT launched in late 2022, there was a massive acceleration. The demand index went from 250 to over 600 in just three years.

What this means in practical terms is that companies across Canada—and globally—are competing for AI engineering talent. And that competition is reflected in compensation. The market has fundamentally shifted in the last two years, and I need to make sure my compensation reflects that reality.

**[Pause, make eye contact]**

Does this market context make sense so far? Any questions before I move to my specific contributions?"

---

### MY CONTRIBUTIONS (5 minutes)

**[Wait for response, then continue]**

"Perfect. So now let me connect this market data to the work I've actually been doing at Synechron.

**[Navigate to Tab 2: Contribution Dashboard]**

**[Point to KPI row]**

Over the past two to three years, I've delivered 8 projects across three different streams:

- 1 client engagement with Synchrony—that was direct revenue-generating work
- 2 FinLabs projects: the M&A Teaser tool and the Credit Memo automation, both of which are now being used internally
- 5 internal builds: zerog, reconAI, the agenda maker, banon, and codesense. These are tools that our team uses regularly to improve efficiency and productivity.

These aren't just small tasks. These are full end-to-end projects where I was responsible for architecture, implementation, testing, and deployment.

**[Navigate to Skills by Stream donut chart]**

Now, let me talk about the technical depth I've built. I've acquired and actively use 27 technical skills across five critical domains.

**[Point to the donut segments]**

The most important area is GenAI—and this is where we're focusing as a company, right? I have 14 skills in this space:
- RAG and GraphRAG for advanced retrieval systems
- Agentic AI and MCP for autonomous systems
- LangChain and LangGraph for orchestration
- Fine-tuning LLMs, prompt engineering, vector databases like Neo4j, ChromaDB, and Pinecone
- All the foundational NLP techniques—NER, NLU, transformers

These aren't buzzwords. I'm using these technologies every day in production systems.

Beyond GenAI, I have:
- 5 deep learning techniques including PyTorch, TensorFlow, gradient masking, and advanced regularization
- 4 integration frameworks: FastAPI, Django, Gradio, Streamlit—I can build full-stack applications from scratch
- 3 architecture capabilities: system design, planning projects from the ground up, and making architectural decisions

**[Navigate to Skills vs Market Demand chart]**

So when I benchmark my skill coverage against what the market is demanding in 2026, I'm at about 90% readiness across all domains. In GenAI specifically—which is our core business—I'm at 4.5 out of 5. I'm only 10% below peak market demand.

**[Navigate to Soft Skills Evolution chart]**

And this isn't just technical work. My soft skills have grown dramatically over the past two years:

- Communication went from 2.5 to 4.5—I'm now presenting to clients and stakeholders regularly
- Leadership grew from 2.0 to 4.0—I'm mentoring junior developers and leading technical discussions
- Problem-solving increased from 3.0 to 4.6
- Adaptability went from 2.5 to 4.7—I've had to learn new technologies constantly and pivot quickly on projects

**[Pause, lean forward slightly]**

Here's the key point I want to make: I'm not doing Junior Associate work anymore. I'm architecting solutions from scratch, interfacing directly with clients, owning end-to-end delivery, and mentoring other team members. That's Associate-level work, and frankly, the market data confirms it."

---

### THE REQUEST (3 minutes)

**[Navigate to Tab 3: Negotiation Summary]**

"So, based on everything I've shown you—the market data, my contributions, my skill development—I'd like to discuss two things.

**[Speak clearly and confidently]**

First, I'd like to progress from Junior Associate to Associate. My responsibilities have already evolved to that level, and I believe the title should reflect the work I'm doing.

**[Point to Suggested Salary Targets card]**

Second, I'd like to adjust my salary to align with market rates. Specifically, I'm proposing a range of $95,000 to $105,000.

Let me break down why these numbers make sense:

- $95,000 is the 25th percentile for Montreal AI engineers with my experience. This is the conservative option—it's essentially saying I'm in the bottom quarter of the market.
  
- $100,000 is the median—the 50th percentile. This is the market rate for someone with my experience and skill set.
  
- $105,000 is the 75th percentile, which I believe reflects my GenAI specialization and the high-impact work I've been delivering.

**[Pause for 3-4 seconds, maintain eye contact]**

I want to be clear about something: this isn't about getting a premium or being paid more than I'm worth. I'm currently $24,000 below market average. What I'm asking for is market correction—bringing my compensation in line with what AI engineers at my level are actually making.

**[Point to Career Aspirations card]**

And this isn't just about the immediate adjustment. I'm committed to Synechron long-term. Here's what I'm planning:

In 2027, I'm applying to MBA programs. I want to complement my technical expertise with business acumen so I can eventually lead teams and drive strategic initiatives.

In 2028, I'm very interested in exploring international mobility opportunities within Synechron. I think working in different markets would broaden my perspective and increase my value to the company.

Long-term, I want to lead AI and ML teams. I want to be someone who's driving innovation at the intersection of technology and business.

**[Lean back slightly, open body language]**

So this salary adjustment isn't just about the past—it's about positioning me to take on even greater responsibilities in the future. I see this as an investment in someone who's already delivering and who's planning to grow with Synechron for years to come.

**[Pause, then ask directly]**

What are your thoughts on this proposal?"

---

### HANDLING RESPONSES

**[Listen carefully to their response, then use the appropriate script below]**

---

#### RESPONSE 1: "We have salary bands for Junior Associates"

"I completely understand that, and I appreciate that you have structured bands. That's actually a big part of why I'm proposing the title change to Associate. 

The work I'm doing—system architecture, client-facing projects, technical leadership—that's not Junior Associate work anymore. It's Associate-level work. And if the title changes to reflect the responsibilities I'm already handling, then the salary should align with the Associate band.

So the question isn't really about stretching the Junior Associate band—it's about recognizing that I've already evolved into the next role. Does that make sense?"

---

#### RESPONSE 2: "This is a significant increase"

"I understand it's a substantial number—we're talking about moving from $71,000 to somewhere in the $95,000 to $105,000 range. That's about a 34% to 48% adjustment.

But here's how I think about it: I'm currently 25% below market average. What I'm proposing isn't a premium above market—it's bringing me to market rate. 

And there's a cost to not making this adjustment. If I were to leave—which I don't want to do—you'd need to:
- Post the role and recruit, which takes 2 to 4 months
- Pay a market-rate salary to attract qualified candidates, which would likely be $95,000 or higher anyway
- Onboard and train someone new, which takes another 3 to 6 months before they're productive
- Lose all the institutional knowledge I've built over three years

So while I understand this is a significant number, the alternative—replacing me—would likely cost more in both dollars and disruption to projects. I'm asking for market alignment for value that's already being delivered."

---

#### RESPONSE 3: "We need to see more tenure before this level of increase"

"I appreciate that perspective. But I want to clarify something: I have 2 to 3 years with Synechron. That's not early career—that's the exact experience level used in my market benchmarking.

The 89 salary records I showed you—those are all from people with 2 to 3 years of experience in AI engineering. So when I say the market average is $95,000, I'm not comparing myself to senior engineers with 10 years of experience. I'm comparing myself to people at my exact stage.

Also, my technical skill acquisition rate is 85% above baseline. I'm not asking you to bet on my potential—I'm asking you to recognize value I've already delivered. The 8 projects, the 27 skills, the client work—that's all done. It's not hypothetical.

So the tenure is there, and the results are there. What I'm asking for is recognition of both."

---

#### RESPONSE 4: "Can we do this in stages?"

"I'm definitely open to discussing the implementation timeline. I understand budget cycles and planning constraints, so if a phased approach works better, here's what I'd suggest:

Immediate—as soon as we can process this:
- Title change to Associate
- Salary adjustment to $95,000, which is the 25th percentile—the conservative end of the range

Then, 6-month review:
- Based on continued delivery and performance, we move to the $100,000 to $105,000 range

That gives you some breathing room on the budget side, and it gives me a clear path to the full market rate. It also means we're acknowledging the gap now and creating a plan to close it, rather than leaving it unresolved.

Does that feel like a workable approach?"

---

#### RESPONSE 5: "What if we can't meet this range?"

"I really appreciate your honesty, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm committed to Synechron—I wouldn't be having this conversation if I wasn't.

If the full salary adjustment isn't feasible right now, could we explore some alternatives?

Option 1: Accelerated review timeline. Instead of waiting a full year, could we do a 3-month or 6-month review specifically focused on closing this compensation gap?

Option 2: Performance bonus structure. If there's a way to tie additional compensation to specific project delivery or KPIs, I'm very open to that. It gives you budget flexibility and gives me a path to market rate.

Option 3: Professional development budget. I mentioned my MBA plans for 2027. If there's a way to support that through tuition reimbursement or a development stipend, that would be valuable to me.

Option 4: Equity or stock options, if those are available in my role. That could be a way to bridge the gap without impacting cash flow immediately.

My goal here isn't to create a hardship for the company or to be unreasonable. My goal is to ensure that my compensation reflects the AI engineering market and the value I'm bringing to Synechron. So I'm flexible on how we get there—I just need to know that we're working toward closing this gap.

What options would be most feasible from your perspective?"

---

### CLOSING (2 minutes)

**[Regardless of their response, use this to wrap up]**

"Let me just summarize what I'm asking for, so we're both clear:

**[Speak slowly and deliberately]**

Position: I'd like to move from Junior Associate to Associate, which reflects the responsibilities I'm already handling.

Salary: I'm proposing a range of $95,000 to $105,000, which aligns with the Montreal AI engineering market for someone with 2 to 3 years of experience.

Justification: 27 technical skills with a GenAI focus, 8 delivered projects, 90% market readiness, and the fact that I'm already performing Associate-level work.

**[Pause, then soften your tone slightly]**

I want to be very clear about something: I'm not looking to leave Synechron. I value the work we're doing, I value the team I'm on, and I'm excited about where the company is going. But I also need to make sure that my compensation reflects my market value and the contributions I'm making.

This conversation is about finding a path forward that works for both of us.

**[Final question, open body language]**

So, what do you think the next steps should be? How do we move forward on this?"

---

### POST-MEETING: IF THEY AGREE

**[Express genuine appreciation]**

"Thank you so much. I really appreciate you hearing me out and recognizing the work I've been doing. This means a lot to me.

What's the timeline for implementing this change? Are we talking a couple weeks, the next pay cycle, or does this need to go through approvals?

**[Wait for answer]**

And once this is approved, could we get this formalized in writing? I just want to make sure we're both on the same page about the details.

**[If they give a timeline]**

Perfect. So just to confirm, we'll reconnect on [date] to finalize everything?

Thanks again. I'm really excited to continue contributing at this level and to keep building with Synechron."

---

### POST-MEETING: IF THEY NEED TIME

**[Stay calm and collaborative]**

"I completely understand. This is a significant decision, and I respect that you need time to evaluate it.

Is there any additional information I can provide that would be helpful? I have more detailed documentation on project impact if that would be useful, or I can break down the skills and contributions in more detail.

**[Wait for answer]**

What would be a reasonable timeline for you to review this and get back to me? Are we talking a week, two weeks, the end of the month?

**[When they give a timeline]**

Okay, so let's plan to reconnect on [date]. Should I send you this dashboard link and presentation materials for your reference?

I appreciate you taking the time to seriously consider this. It really matters to me."

---

### POST-MEETING: IF THEY DECLINE

**[Stay professional, don't get emotional]**

"I appreciate you being upfront with me. I'm disappointed, obviously, but I respect that you have constraints I may not be aware of.

Can I ask: what's the gap between what I'm requesting and what's feasible right now? Is it the full amount, the timing, the title change, or something else?

**[Listen to their explanation]**

Okay, I hear you. If the salary adjustment to $95,000 to $105,000 isn't possible right now, would any of these alternatives be workable:
- Title change to Associate without immediate salary adjustment?
- Smaller adjustment now with an accelerated review in 3 to 6 months?
- Performance bonus or project-based compensation?

**[If all are declined]**

I understand. Can I ask one more question: what would I need to demonstrate to reach this compensation range in the next 6 to 12 months? What specific outcomes or performance metrics would make this adjustment possible?

**[Listen, take notes]**

Okay. I'd like to formally request a review in [3 or 6] months to revisit this conversation. Can we schedule that now so it's on both our calendars?

**[End professionally]**

I appreciate your time today, even though we didn't arrive at the outcome I was hoping for. I'm going to keep delivering at a high level, and I hope we can revisit this soon."
